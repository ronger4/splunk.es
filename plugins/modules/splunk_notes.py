module: splunk_notes
short_description: Manage notes for findings, investigations, and response plan tasks
description:
  - This module allows for creation, update, and deletion of notes in Splunk Enterprise Security.
  - Notes can be created for findings, investigations, or response plan tasks.
  - Use C(target_type) to specify where the note should be attached.
  - When C(state=present) without C(note_id), a new note is created.
  - When C(state=present) with C(note_id), the existing note is updated.
  - When C(state=absent) with C(note_id), the note is deleted.
  - Note creation (without C(note_id)) is B(NOT idempotent). Each call creates a new note,
    even if the content is identical. This is by design, as notes are meant to be additive
    and multiple notes with the same content may be intentional.
  - Note updates (with C(note_id)) B(ARE idempotent). The module compares the existing note's
    content with the desired state and only updates if there are differences.
version_added: "5.1.0"
options:
  target_type:
