minor_changes:
  - Modernized Python code across the collection by removing Python 2 compatibility
    patterns (``from __future__ import`` and ``__metaclass__ = type``), updating to
    modern ``super()`` syntax, converting ``.format()`` calls to f-strings, and
    consolidating duplicated ``_check_argspec()`` methods into the shared
    ``check_argspec()`` helper.
